This repository contains a collection of resources on git and Github, compiled for the Georgia Tech Discrete Math and Molecular Biology research group under the direction of Prof. Christine Heitsch.

Most of these resources were written by Anna Kirkpatrick, and questions on these topics should be directed to Anna for the foreseeable future.

As of 10/10/18, this repository contains:
git_tutorial – a tutorial on common git commands and workflow, currently work in progress
git_workflows - cookbook style instructions for a few simple workflows with git and Github, includes relevant best practices
git_commandments – a short list of community expectations regarding the use of git and Github in the research group
setting_up_updates_repo - step-by-step instructions for setting up a repository to record weekly progress updates
slack_notifications_github_enterprise_instructions – instructions for setting up slack integration with repositories hosted on Github Enterprise

Help! Where do I start?

If you only need to use git for weekly updates: 
*setting_up_updates_repo.md

If you don't have (much) familiarity with git and will be using git for weekly updates and code: 
*start with the first few sections of git_tutorial.md
*then read and follow the instructions in setting_up_updates_repo.md
*then return to the tutorial
*after you have the basics, read git_workflows.md and use it as a reference

If you don't have much familiarity with git and will be using it for code only:
*start with git_tutorial.md
*after you have the basics, read git_workflows.md and use it as a reference

If you have used git some in the past, but don't feel confidant in your skills:
*review the install and setup sections of git_tutorial.md
*read git_workflows.md and use it as a guide as you work for the first few weeks
*follow the instructions in setting_up_updates_repo.md to set up your updates repository (if needed)
*consult the tutorial and/or other sources as needed

If you know git but are new to Heitsch research group:
*review git_commandments.md for community expectations
*skim setting_up_updates_repo.md for update repository expectations
*consult git_tutorial.md and slack_notifications_github_enterprise_instructions.txt as needed to address the peculiar aspects of Georgia Tech computer systems in the School of Math
